# TCLI
A Twitter command line interface, interact with the twitter api via terminal

# Commands

/help - Info on all comands

/end - ends program

/user* - Enter a twitter ScreenName after typing /user* | ex: /user*joe

/tweet* - Enter your tweet after typing /tweet* | ex /tweet*Hi from my terminal

# How To Use

Make sure TCLI.go and Structs.go are in the same folder than use *go run *.go

# Additional Info

With the current way the program is writen, you will require credentials only available to twitter users with api access, 
so most use cases i'm assuming is just new twitter devs who just want to see an example or want to test and make sure their credentials work.
